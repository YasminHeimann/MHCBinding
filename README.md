# MHCBinding
The project is aiming to improve the prediction of MHC-I biniding affinity to immune epitopes 
by cleaning and analysing the IEDB.org DB and training the results using
MHCFlurry deep learning network on multiple manipulated versions 
of the IEDB.

The IEDB database holds the binding affinity (Kd, EC50 etc.) of MHC molecules and immune epitopes

The project review and outcomes can be found in the final paper attached in the repository.
